Contract-First IDP is a developer platform reference architecture and a corresponding set of Golden Paths designed to support a productive developer experience, especially for contract-driven integration scenarios. The developer platform reference manifest takes a GitOps approach for platform automation and the golden path templates are designed to streamline a contract-first development methodology.
